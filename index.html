                    <h1>Aurora Borealis, Northern Lights</h1>
                    <p1>Here are some facts about the northern lights:</p1>
                    <ul>
                        <p>The Northern Lights occur when gas particles in the Earth’s
                            atmosphere collide with charged particles from the sun’s atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>The different colours of the Aurora Borealis
                            occur due to the different types of gas particles. </p>
                        <p>Northern lights occur on the north pole of the earth, 
                            and southern lights occur on the south pole.</p>
                    </ul>
